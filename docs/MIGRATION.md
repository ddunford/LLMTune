        model=model,
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        train_dataset=dataset,
        dataset_text_field="text",
        max_seq_length=512,
        dataset_num_proc=1,  # Single process for stability

```

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

### Training Speed
- **Baseline (Axolotl)**: Standard PyTorch training speed
- **New (Unsloth)**: 2-5x faster with automatic optimizations
- **Gradient Computation**: Optimized gradient accumulation and processing
- **Memory Management**: Reduced memory fragmentation and better utilization

### GPU Utilization
- **Before**: Single GPU or failed multi-GPU setup
- **After**: Automatic dual GPU distribution with model parallelism

**Example GPU Usage:**
```bash
# During Unsloth Training
